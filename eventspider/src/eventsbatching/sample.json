The group started out recording at Dogwood Lodge, site of an unused summer camp on Lake Chickamauga in a large, open room with mobile recording gear over a week in the summer of 2015. More recording and mixing was done at Barbe&#39;s Athens, GA studio, Chase Park Transduction with additional recording at New Madrid&#39;s home base, The Barn.<br><br> New Madrid formed in Fall of 2010, and shortly after was approached by Barbe, who invited them to his studio to record their first full-length album, Yardboat.

The group formed in 2014 around the spectral, wandering songwriting of Daniel Mitchell (formerly of the Honest Sleeves). An early version of the group consisted of Mitchell and guitarist James Sauer (also of Donovan The Shark). Currently accompanied by drummer Myles Coyne (also of Myles Coyne and the Rusty Nickel Band, Animals In Human Attire and Temple) and bassist Dan Oberbruner, Ladders&#39; songs have increasingly incorporated classic rock, power pop, country and post rock influences. The group&#39;s first album, &quot;&quot;Suha,&quot;&quot; which features a contribution from Chris Porterfield of Field Report, will be released by the Bread King label on Oct. 30, 2014. Songs from the album have appeared on FM 102.1, 91.7 WMSE and The Milwaukee Record.<br><a></a>  <br>  </p>","modified":"2016-05-14 09:15:15","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"moffkr","linker":"evdb","name":"New Madrid","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/performers/new-madrid-/P0-001-014203813-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-014203813-3","short_bio":"Psychedelic Rock"}},"title":"New Madrid -  Ladders","venue_address":"121 W Main Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/029/493/460-2.jpeg_/new-madrid-60.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/029/493/460-2.jpeg_/new-madrid-60.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/029/493/460-2.jpeg_/new-madrid-60.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/029/493/460-2.jpeg_/new-madrid-60.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-05-03 06:50:01","venue_id":"V0-001-000458803-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Frequency","venue_url":"http://madison.eventful.com/venues/the-frequency-/V0-001-000458803-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"WI","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"43.0647844","groups":null,"url":"http://madison.eventful.com/events/songwriters-circle-hosted-anthony-lamarr-/E0-001-094254675-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094254675-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Madison","link_count":null,"longitude":"-89.4171932","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Wisconsin","start_time":"2016-07-29 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Songwriters Circle is an intimate evening of storytelling and music.
