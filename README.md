# Event-Spider
A web scraping application for events

#### What it does
Event Spider creates a custom events calendar based on your location and preferred tags. You choose what you want to
see, what kinds of reminders you want, and how to spread the word about the events you've found.

#### How it works
Event Spider uses two different approaches to finding event. First, Event Spider links into several event search
websites, like Evenful, Eventbrite, and Meetup. Second, Event Spider has its own crawlers (or spiders) to search for
events on the websites you want, such as a local school or newspaper. Set the sources you want, or search for brand-new ones.

Event Spider uses Apache Lucene for powerful indexing and searching of events, and Apache Nutch for rapid web scraping. Integration with Google Calendar keeps your event calendar synched across your devices and always at the ready.
